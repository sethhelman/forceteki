/**
 * Represents an action ability provided by card text.
 *
 * Properties:
 * title        - string that is used within the card menu associated with this
 *                action.
 * condition    - optional function that should return true when the action is
 *                allowed, false otherwise. It should generally be used to check
 *                if the action can modify game state (step #1 in ability
 *                resolution in the rules).
 * cost         - object or array of objects representing the cost required to
 *                be paid before the action will activate. See Costs.
 * phase        - string representing which phases the action may be executed.
 *                Defaults to 'any' which allows the action to be executed in
 *                any phase.
 * location     - string indicating the location the card should be in in order
 *                to activate the action. Defaults to 'play area'.
 * limit        - optional AbilityLimit object that represents the max number of
 *                uses for the action as well as when it resets.
 * clickToActivate - boolean that indicates the action should be activated when
 *                   the card is clicked.
